# VPC Peering
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. I will demonstrate how to set one up between 2 VPC's.

### Step 1: The Setup ‚òëÔ∏è
- 3 EC2 instances running in their own VPC

**_See Screenshot Below_**

- notice how you are unable to communicate with another instance because they live in their own VPC's, of which have no kind of connections at all
- ping is not working

### Step 2: Create and Configure VPC üîê ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Navigate to VPC ```peering connections``` and select ```Create Peering Connection```
- Then select VPC _Requester_ and _Acceptor_

**_See Screenshot Below_**

- Accept VPC connection, since all VPC's are in the same account we can accept the connection ourselves

### Step 3: Configure Route Tables üõ£
- Navigate to Route Tables and find the route tables for the VPC's being connected

- Edit the VPC route table for each VPC, enter the other VPC's IP address and set Peering connection as target

**_See Screenshot Below**_

### Step 4: Configure Security Group üß±
- Navigate to Security groups and locate security group for the VPC's being connected
- Edit inbound rules of Security Groups

- Since both VPC's are in the same region we can just reference them in the Security Groups

**_See Screenshot Below_**

### Step 3: Confirmation ‚úîÔ∏è
- Ping from instance in one VPC to the other now works
